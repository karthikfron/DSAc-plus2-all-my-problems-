# DSA Day 1: Understanding Concepts, Data Types, and Solving the Array Sum Problem

## Overview

Welcome to Day 1 of our DSA learning journey! Today, we'll delve into fundamental concepts, explore essential data types, and tackle a practical problem related to arrays.

## Concepts Covered

- **Data Structures:** Understanding the basics of data structures and their significance in algorithmic problem-solving.
  
- **Data Types:** Exploring different data types in programming languages and their applications.

## Problem Statement: Array Sum

**Task:** Write a program to find the sum of all elements in an array.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Your code here

    return 0;
}
```
